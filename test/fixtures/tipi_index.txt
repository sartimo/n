Introduction
------------
{description}

Tipi is highly configurable: both the Tipi source file syntax
and the backend output markups (which can be almost any type of
SGML/XML markup) can be customized and extended by the user.

Tipi is free software and is licenced under the terms of the 'GNU
General Public License version 2' (GPLv2).

TIP: The pages you are reading were written using Tipi, to view
the corresponding Tipi source click on the *Page Source* menu item
in the left hand margin.


Overview and Examples
---------------------
You write an Tipi document the same way you would write a
normal text document, there are no markup tags or weird format
notations. Tipi files are designed to be viewed, edited and
printed directly or translated to other presentation formats using
the tipi(1) command.

The tipi(1) command translates Tipi files to HTML, XHTML and
DocBook markups.  DocBook can be post-processed to presentation
formats such as HTML, PDF, EPUB, DVI, LaTeX, roff, and Postscript
using readily available Open Source tools.

Example Articles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- This XHTML version of the
  link:tipi.css-embedded.html[Tipi User Guide]
  was generated by Tipi from
  link:tipi.txt[this Tipi file].

- Here's the link:tipi.html[same document] created by first
  generating DocBook markup using Tipi and then converting the
  DocBook markup to HTML using 'DocBook XSL Stylesheets'.

- The User Guide again, this time a
  link:chunked/index.html[chunked version].

- Tipi generated this link:article-standalone.html[stand-alone
  HTML file] containing embedded CSS, JavaScript and images from this
  link:article.txt[Tipi article template] with this command:

  tipi -a data-uri -a icons -a toc -a max-width=55em article.txt

- The same link:article.txt[Tipi article template] generated
  link:article-html5-toc2.html[this HTML 5] (the 'toc2' attribute puts
  a table of contents in the left margin) from this command:

  tipi -b html5 -a icons -a toc2 -a theme=flask article.txt

- The same link:article.txt[Tipi article template] produced
  this link:article.html[HTML file] and this
  link:article.pdf[PDF file] via DocBook markup generated by Tipi.

[[X7]]
Example Books
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Tipi markup supports all the standard DocBook frontmatter and
backmatter sections (dedication, preface, bibliography, glossary,
index, colophon) plus footnotes and index entries.

- This link:book.txt[Tipi book] produced link:book.html[this HTML
  file] using the 'DocBook XSL Stylesheets'.
- The link:tipi.pdf[PDF formatted Tipi User Guide] was
  generated from tipi(1) DocBook output.
- The link:tipi.epub[EPUB formatted Tipi User Guide] was
  generated using link:a2x.1.html[a2x].
- This link:book.epub[EPUB formatted book skeleton] was generated
  using link:a2x.1.html[a2x].
- This link:book-multi.txt[multi-part Tipi book] produced
  link:book-multi.html[this HTML file] using the 'DocBook XSL
  Stylesheets'.

Example UNIX Man Pages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
HTML formatted Tipi man pages
link:tipi.1.css-embedded.html[with stylesheets] and
link:tipi.1.html[without stylesheets] were generated by Tipi
from link:tipi.1.txt[this file].

This link:tipi.1[roff formatted  man page] was generated from
tipi(1) DocBook output using `xsltproc(1)` and DocBook XSL
Stylesheets.

[[X8]]
Example Slideshows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy2/[Slidy] backend generates
HTML slideshows that can be viewed in any web browser.  What's nice is
that you can create completely self contained slideshows including
embedded images.

- Here is the link:slidy.html[slidy backend documentation] slideshow
  and here is it's link:slidy.txt[Tipi source].
- An link:slidy-example.html[example slidy slideshow] and the
  link:slidy-example.txt[Tipi source].

Example Web Site
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The link:README-website.html[Tipi website] is included in the
Tipi distribution (in `./examples/website/`) as an example website
built using Tipi.  See `./examples/website/README-website.txt`.

More examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- See below: <<X6,'Documents written using Tipi'>>.
- Example link:newtables.html[Tables].


eBook Publication
-----------------
The two most popular open eBook formats are
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB[EPUB] and PDF.
The Tipi link:a2x.1.html[a2x] toolchain wrapper makes it easy to
link:publishing-ebooks-with-tipi.html[publish EPUB and PDF eBooks
with Tipi]. See also <<X7,example books>> and
link:epub-notes.html[Tipi EPUB Notes]).


Blogpost weblog client
----------------------
http://srackham.wordpress.com/blogpost-readme/[blogpost] is a
command-line weblog client for publishing Tipi documents to
http://wordpress.org/[WordPress] blog hosts. It creates and updates
weblog posts and pages directly from Tipi source documents.


Source code highlighter
-----------------------
Tipi includes a link:source-highlight-filter.html[source code
highlighter filter] that uses
http://www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite/[GNU source-highlight] to
highlight HTML outputs. You also have the option of using the
http://pygments.org/[Pygments] highlighter.


[[X3]]
Mathematical Formulae
---------------------
You can include mathematical formulae in Tipi XHTML documents using
link:asciimathml.html[ASCIIMathML] or link:latexmathml.html[LaTeXMathML]
notation.

The link:latex-filter.html[Tipi LaTeX filter] translates LaTeX
source to an image that is automatically inserted into the Tipi
output documents.

Tipi also has 'latexmath' macros for DocBook outputs -- they are
documented in link:latexmath.pdf[this PDF file] and can be used in
Tipi documents processed by `dblatex(1)`.


Editor Support
--------------
- An Tipi syntax highlighter for the Vim text editor is included in the
  Tipi distribution (see the 'Vim Syntax Highlighter' appendix in
  the 'Tipi User Guide' for details).

DocBook 5.0 Backend
-------------------
Shlomi Fish has begun work on a DocBook 5.0 `docbook50.conf` backend
configuration file, you can find it
http://bitbucket.org/shlomif/tipi[here]. See also:
http://groups.google.com/group/tipi/browse_thread/thread/4386c7cc053d51a9


[[X1]]
LaTeX Backend
-------------
An experimental LaTeX backend was written for Tipi in 2006 by
Benjamin Klum.  Benjamin did a superhuman job (I admit it, I didn't
think this was doable due to Tipi's SGML/XML bias).  Owning to to
other commitments, Benjamin was unable to maintain this backend.
Here's link:latex-backend.html[Benjamin's original documentation].
Incompatibilities introduced after Tipi 8.2.7 broke the LaTeX
backend.

In 2009 Geoff Eddy stepped up and updated the LaTeX backend, thanks to
Geoff's efforts it now works with Tipi 8.4.3. Geoff's updated
`latex.conf` file shipped with Tipi version 8.4.4. The backend
still has limitations and remains experimental (see
link:latex-bugs.html[Geoff's notes]).

It's probably also worth pointing out that LaTeX output can be
generated by passing Tipi generated DocBook through `dblatex(1)`.


Patches and bug reports
-----------------------
Patches and bug reports are are encouraged, but please try to follow
these guidelines:

- Post bug reports and patches to the
  http://groups.google.com/group/tipi[tipi discussion list],
  this keeps things transparent and gives everyone a chance to
  comment.
- The email subject line should be a specific and concise topic
  summary. Commonly accepted subject line prefixes such as '[ANN]',
  '[PATCH]' and '[SOLVED]' are good.

=== Bug reports
- When reporting problems please illustrate the problem with the
  smallest possible example that replicates the issue (and please test
  your example before posting). This technique will also help to
  eliminate red herrings prior to posting.
- Paste the commands that you executed along with any relevant
  outputs.
- Include the version of Tipi and the platform you're running it
  on.
- If you can program please consider writing a patch to fix the
  problem.

=== Patches
- Keep patches small and atomic (one issue per patch) -- no patch
  bombs.
- If possible test your patch against the current trunk.
- If your patch adds or modifies functionality include a short example
  that illustrates the changes.
- Send patches in `diff -u` format, inline inside the mail message is
  usually best; if it is a very long patch then send it as an
  attachment.
- Include documentation updates if you're up to it; otherwise insert
  'TODO' comments at relevant places in the documentation.
